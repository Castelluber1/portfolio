										<h3 class="headline-4">1. Problem</h3>
										<p class="text-2">
											Following a disappointing marketing campaign, the
											management started to question the effectiveness of the
											assets used. They wanted to figure out what went wrong and
											make improvements so they could try again later with
											better chances of success.
										</p>

									<div class="col-12 col-md-6 mb-2 mb-lg-2 mb-xl-2">
										<h3 class="headline-4">2. Challenge</h3>
										<p class="text-2">
											Given that the mortgage campaign had failed, we were
											tasked with the challenge of identifying and developing
											digital assets to relaunch the same campaign within a few
											weeks.

									<div class="col-12 col-md-6 mb-2 mb-lg-2 mb-xl-2">
										<h3 class="headline-4">3. Research</h3>

											After conducting initial landscape research and user
											interviews, we discovered that users were not appreciating
											the performance of the landing page and calculator.

									<div class="col-12 col-md-6 mb-2 mb-lg-2 mb-xl-2">
										<h3 class="headline-4">4. Development</h3>
										<p class="text-2">
											We used feedback to create and test a prototype.
											Encouraged by positive responses, we developed a custom
											landing page and calculator to address initial issues.

									<div class="col-12 col-md-6 mb-2 mb-lg-2 mb-xl-2">
										<h3 class="headline-4">5. Outcome</h3>
										<p class="text-2">
											The campaign was relaunched four weeks later and surpassed
											all expectations by generating over $50 million in
											mortgage loans in less than five weeks.

										<p class="text-2">
											According to our research users were overwhelmed at first

											"amortization period". After inputting their information,

											We reduced the number of fields to simplify the process

										<p class="text-2">
											The analytics reinforced the initial discoveries around
											low speed performance. One other indicator that caught my
											attention was the "Bounce rate," which measures the
											percentage of visitors who leave a website without any
											interaction. The company's overall bounce rate was higher
											than the industry average, and this page had a
											significantly higher bounce rate compared to others.

										<p class="text-2">
											The new custom-coded page performed much better,
											particularly in terms of speed, which was a problem
											highlighted by feedback initially. The bounce rate was
											reduced by 50%, indicating a significant improvement in
											how users engage with the website and its overall
											performance.

										<p class="text-2">
											Similar to what we found before, users on this page also
											struggled to find the information they wanted. The
											detailed sections, like rates, overwhelmed users who
											weren't at that stage yet.

											Users could find information faster on the new design, and
											they found the overall experience much better. The
